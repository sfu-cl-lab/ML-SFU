- labName: "Natural Language Lab"
  picPath: "natlang.jpg"
  description: "
   Our lab has a particular focus on research into statistical machine translation and the visual and textual summarization of information contained in natural language. We are always looking for motivated, good graduate students. We are also keen on fostering links with industry for joint projects that are based on research grants and/or student internships that allow graduate students to spend time at companies doing high-risk high-reward natural language processing projects."

- labName: "Database and Data Mining Lab"
  picPath: "cl.jpg"
  description: "Our lab also investigates emerging applications of information systems posing new database systems challenges such as on-demand map generation and focused web crawlers. The challenges of on-demand map generation, for example, are the complexity of map generalization operations and the ill-defined notion of the quality of the resulting maps. "
