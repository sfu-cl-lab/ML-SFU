        title: Certified Trustworthiness in the Era of Large Language Models
        description: "Along with the wide deployment of deep learning (DL) systems, their lack of trustworthiness, such as their lack of robustness, fairness, and numerical reliability, is raising serious social concerns, especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and aircraft navigation. Hence, a rigorous and accurate evaluation of the trustworthiness of DL systems is important and would be a prerequisite for improving DL trustworthiness. The first part of the talk will be an overview of certified methods for DL trustworthiness. These methods provide computable guarantees for DL systems in terms of worst-case trustworthiness under certain realistic conditions, such as the accuracy lower bound against arbitrary tiny perturbations. Based on our taxonomy and systematization, we reveal key methodologies and implications of certified DL trustworthiness. We will illustrate two concrete methods: semantic randomized smoothing and branch-and-bound with differentiable linear relaxations. As a representative of recent DL breakthroughs, large language models (LLMs) are transforming our lives, but on the other hand, posing more challenges to trustworthiness. For example, LLMs can be jailbroken with adversarial prompts to output harmful content with bias, harassment, misinformation, and more. The second part of the talk will be an overview of LLM trustworthiness. We will start with sharing my hands-on experience in developing state-of-the-art LLMs in the industry, then illustrate common LLM trustworthiness issues via examples, and conclude by envisioning certifiable trustworthiness for LLMs"

        title: Automated, Interpretable, and Scalable Scientific Machine Learning
        description: "The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by data-centric scaling laws, have significantly transformed our understanding and generation of both vision and language. However, natural media, such as images, videos, and languages, represent only a fraction of the modalities we encounter, leaving much of the physical world underexplored. We propose that Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) offers a knowledge-driven framework that complements data-driven AI, enabling us to better understand, visualize, and interact with the diverse complexities of the physical world.  In this talk, we will delve into the cutting-edge intersection of AI and SciML. First, we will discuss the automation of scientific analysis through multi-step reasoning grounded with formal languages, paving the way for more advanced control and interactions in scientific models. Second, we will demonstrate how SciML can streamline the visualization of intricate geometries, while also showing how spatial intelligence can be adapted for more robust SciML modeling. Finally, we will explore how scaling scientific data can train foundation models that integrate multiphysics knowledge, thereby enhancing traditional simulations with a deeper understanding of physical principles."
