  title: "Routing and Scheduling in Answer Set Programming applied to Multi-Agent Path Finding"
  abstract: "We present alternative approaches to routing and scheduling in Answer Set Programming (ASP), and explore them in the context of Multi-agent Path Finding. The idea is to capture the flow of time in terms of partial orders rather than time steps attached to actions and fluents. This also abolishes the need for fixed upper bounds on the length of plans. The trade-off for this avoidance is that (parts of) temporal trajectories must be acyclic, since multiple occurrences of the same action or fluent cannot be distinguished anymore. While this approach provides an interesting alternative for modeling routing, it is without alternative for scheduling since fine-grained timings cannot be represented in ASP in a feasible way. This is different for partial orders that can be efficiently handled by external means such as acyclicity and difference constraints. We formally elaborate upon this idea and present several resulting ASP encodings. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness via an empirical analysis."

  title: "Towards off-the-shelf monocular depth estimators"
  abstract: "With enough knowledge about the world we are looking at, a single image is enough to recover the 3D structure of the scene in front of our eye(s) - when we close one eye we still perceive the world in 3D. Computer vision started to explore monocular depth estimation (“monodepth”) much later than depth from stereo images (or, equivalently, camera motion). It is only recently that computational methods for monodepth have reached a comparable maturity. In the talk, I will briefly recap the development of monodepth algorithms over the past 20 years, and present our own contributions to the topic. I will argue that we may be reaching the point where monodepth modules become a commodity that we download and deploy off-the-shelf, just like stereo reconstruction."

  title: "Scaling Graph Transformers with Expander Graphs"
  abstract: "Following their runaway success in modelling natural language and other areas, there has been much recent attention to different variants of Transformers for graph data, which may be more able to handle long-range dependencies than previous variants of graph neural networks. These models generally allow all nodes to attend to all other nodes, however, leading to both computational and statistical challenges. This talk will present two models that help with this problem. Exphormer adds “virtual nodes” as well as augmenting the attention mechanism with an expander graph, whose mathematical characteristics help propagate long-range information at cost only linear in the size of the graph. Incorporating this into the GraphGPS framework realized state-of-the-art performance on several interesting datasets. For relatively-dense input graphs, however, even attention on the original graph structure may be too expensive to run for especially large graphs. We demonstrate that even low-width graph Transformers can provide useful signal as to which attention pathways are important in a large graph, and use this to propose Spexphormer, a model which scales Exphormers to very large graphs in transductive settings."

  title: "Optimizing AI Models for Human Use"
  abstract: "In many applications, machine learning models are deployed for human use (e.g., a diagnostic assistant for clinicians). Over the last 2 years, this setting has become even more widespread with the adoption of large language models (LLMs) as assistants in a wide variety of contexts spanning both professional and non-professional disciplines. In this talk, we explore through a set of case studies how we might incorporate humans in the ML training paradigm. These case studies include (1) applying classical computer vision models in a clinical trial study to assistant patients in taking higher quality medical images in telemedicine, (2) using an empirical model for human behavior to fine-tune a generic classifier to align with human utilization, and (3) analyzing human interaction patterns with image generation models. We also present some initial results that are inspired by the methods of (2) to the large language model setting. Across these studies, we take the position and discuss why it is imperative to treat humans as part of the model optimization process."

  abstract: "From visual servoing, ProMPs, and DMPs to reinforcement learning and embodied artificial intelligence, we’ve seen how these computational models excel across various levels of problems in robotics -- from task specification and motion planning to sensorimotor control and reasoning. But, is there a universal computing model for robotics that solves all the problems and its capabilities regarding motion dexterity, environment perception and reasoning, and human-robot interaction scale up with the size of a full spectrum of datasets? In this talk, I will share my research journey on multiple attempts to build general-purpose robotic task solvers. I will start from my early efforts of developing geometric task specification methods, to real-world robotic reinforcement learning solutions, and finally, to our recent work on embodied reasoning, which connects multi-modal LLM to robotics. I aim to demonstrate why, despite progress, these solutions have yet to fully meet our expectations, and I invite a lively discussion on these findings."

  abstract: "In this talk, we explore the synergy between Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Spectral Graph Theory, presenting two advancements: 1) Specformer, a novel spectral GNN architecture, and 2) in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization bounds for GNNs based on spectral graph theory. In Specformer, we improve traditional spectral GNNs by incorporating a set-to-set spectral filter with self-attention mechanisms, achieving expressiveness while maintaining permutation equivariance. Specformer significantly outperforms existing models in synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating a better ability to capture complex spectral patterns. Concurrently, we significantly tighten the PAC-Bayes in-distribution generalization bounds for GNNs and provide new out-of-distribution generalization bounds based on spectral graph theory. Our empirical validations confirm that GNNs achieve strong size generalization performance in cases guaranteed by our theory."

  abstract: "Today, thousands of robots are navigating autonomously in warehouses, transporting goods from one location to another. While numerous planning algorithms are developed to coordinate robots more efficiently and robustly, warehouse layouts remain largely unchanged – they still adhere to the traditional pattern designed for human workers rather than robots. In this talk, I will share our recent progress in exploring layout design and optimization to enhance large-scale multi-robot coordination. I will first introduce a direct layout design method, followed by a method to optimize layout generators instead of layouts. I will then extend these ideas to virtual layout design, which does not require changes to the physical world that robots navigate and thus has the potential for applications beyond automated warehouses."

  title: "Multi-Agent Path Finding and Its Applications"
  abstract: "The coordination of robots and other agents becomes more and more important for industry. For example, on the order of one thousand robots already navigate autonomously in Amazon fulfillment centers to move inventory pods all the way from their storage locations to the picking stations that need the products they store (and vice versa). Optimal and even some approximately optimal path planning for these robots is NP-hard, yet one must find high-quality collision-free paths for them in real-time. Algorithms for such multi-agent path-finding problems have been studied in robotics and theoretical computer science for a longer time but are insufficient since they are either fast but of insufficient solution quality or of good solution quality but too slow. In this talk, I will discuss different variants of multi-agent path-finding problems, cool ideas for both solving them and executing the resulting plans robustly, and several of their applications.
Our research on this topic has been funded by both NSF and Amazon Robotics."

  abstract: "The digitalization of manufacturing is turning fabrication hardware into computers. As traditional tools, such as computer aided design, manufacturing, and engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) lag behind this new paradigm, the field of computational fabrication has recently emerged from computer graphics to address this knowledge gap with a computer-science mindset. Computer graphics is extremely powerful in creating content for the virtual world. The connection is therefore a natural one as the digital fabrication hardware is starving for innovative content. In this talk, I will focus on inverse design, a powerful paradigm of content synthesis for digital fabrication, which creates fabricable designs given the desired performances. Specifically, I will discuss a class of inverse design problems that deals with data-driven neural surrogate models. These surrogates learn and replace a forward process, such as a computationally heavy simulation."

  title: "Learning Options by Extracting Programs from Neural Networks"
  abstract: "In this talk, I argue for a programmatic mindset in reinforcement learning, proposing that agents should generate libraries of programs encoding reusable behaviors. When faced with a new task, the agent learns how to combine existing programs and generate new ones. This approach can be helpful even when policies are encoded in seemingly non-decomposable representations like neural networks. I will show that neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions can be mapped to a program with if-then-else structures. Such a program can then be easily decomposed into sub-programs with the same input type of the original network. In the case of networks encoding policies, each sub-program can be seen as an option---a temporally extended action. All these sub-programs form a library of agent behaviors that can be reused later, in downstream tasks. Considering that even small networks can encode a large number of sub-programs, we select sub-programs that are likely to generalize to unseen tasks. This is achieved through a subset selection procedure that minimizes the Levin loss. Empirical evidence from challenging exploration scenarios in two grid-world domains demonstrates that our methodology can extract helpful programs, thus speeding up the learning process in tasks that are similar and yet distinct from the one used to train the original model."
  bio: "Dr. Levi Lelis is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta, an Amii Fellow, and a CIFAR AI Chair. Levi’s research is dedicated to the development of principled algorithms to solve combinatorial search problems. These problems are integral to optimizing tasks in various sectors. Levi’s research group is focused on combinatorial search problems arising from the search for programmatic solutions---computer programs written in a domain-specific language encoding problem solutions. Levi believes that the most promising path to creating agents that learn continually, efficiently, and safely is to represent the agents’ knowledge programmatically. While programmatic representations offer many advantages, including modularity and reusability, they present a significant challenge: the need to search over large, non-differentiable spaces not suited for gradient descent methods. Addressing this challenge is the current focus of Levi’s work."

  title: "Quantum Computing for Robust Fitting"
  abstract: "Many computer vision applications need to recover structure from imperfect measurements of the real world. The task is often solved by robustly fitting a geometric model onto noisy and outlier-contaminated data. However, relatively recent theoretical analyses indicate that many commonly used formulations of robust fitting in computer vision are not amenable to tractable solution and approximation. In this paper, we explore the usage of quantum computers for robust fitting. To do so, we examine the feasibility of two types of quantum computer technologies---universal gate quantum computers and quantum annealers---to solve robust fitting. Novel algorithms that are amenable to the quantum machines have been developed, and experimental results on current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ) will be reported. Our work thus proposes one of the first quantum treatments of robust fitting for computer vision."

  abstract: "In this talk I will discuss recent methods from my group that focus on addressing some of the core challenges of current visual and multi-modal cognition, including efficient learning, bias and user-controlled generation. Centering on these larger themes I will talk about a number of strategies (and corresponding papers) that we developed to address these challenges. I will start by discussing transfer learning techniques in the context of a semi-supervised object detection and segmentation, highlighting a model that is applicable to a range of supervision: from zero to a few instance-level samples per novel class. I will then talk about our recent work on building a foundational image representation model by combining two successful strategies of masking and sequential token prediction. I will also discuss some of our work on scene graph generation which, in addition to improving overall performance, allows for scalable inference and ability to control data bias (by trade off major improvements on rare classes for minor declines on most common classes). The talk will end with some of our recent work on generative modeling which focuses on novel-view synthesis and language-conditioned diffusion-based story generation. The core of the latter approach is visual memory that implicitly captures the actor and background context across the generated frames. Sentence-conditioned soft attention over the memories enables effective reference resolution and learns to maintain scene and actor consistency when needed."

  title: "Building Practical Statistical Relational Learning Systems"
  abstract: "In our increasingly connected world, data comes from many different sources, in many different forms, and is noisy, complex, and structured. To confront modern data, we need to embrace the structure inherent in the data and in the predictions. An effective means of approaching this problem of structured prediction, is statistical relational learning (SRL). SRL frameworks use weighted logical and arithmetic expressions to easily create probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to jointly reason over interdependent data. However, despite being well suited for modern, interconnected data, SRL has several challenges that keep it from becoming practical and widely used in the machine learning community. In this talk, I address four pillars of practicality for SRL systems: scalability, expressivity, model adaptability, and usability."

  title: "Towards Controllable 3D Content Creation by leveraging Geometric Priors"
  abstract: "The growing popularity for extended realities pushes the demand for the automatic creation and synthesis of new 3D content that would otherwise be a tedious and laborious process. A key property needed to make 3D content creation useful is user controllability as it allows one to realize specific ideas. User-control can be of various forms, e.g. target scans, input images or programmatic edits etc. In this talk, I will be touching works that enable user-control through i) object parts and ii) sparse scene images by leveraging geometric priors. The former utilizes object semantic priors by proposing a novel shape space factorization through an introduced cross diffusion network that enabled multiple applications in both shape generation and editing. The latter leverages pretrained models of large 2D datasets for sparse view 3D NeRF reconstruction of scenes by learning a distribution of geometry represented as ambiguity-aware depth estimates. As an add-on, we will also briefly revisit the volume rendering equation in NeRFs and reformulate it to piecewise linear density that alleviates underlying issues caused by quadrature instability."

  title: "Uncertain Surface Reconstruction"
  abstract: "We propose a method to introduce uncertainty to the surface reconstruction problem. Specifically, we introduce a statistical extension of the classic Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm for recovering shapes from 3D point clouds. Instead of outputting an implicit function, we represent the reconstructed shape as a modified Gaussian Process, which allows us to conduct statistical queries (e.g., the likelihood of a point in space being on the surface or inside a solid). We show that this perspective improves PSR's integration into the online scanning process, broadens its application realm, and opens the door to other lines of research such as applying task-specific priors."

  title: "Incorporating Commonsense Reasoning into NLP Models"
  abstract: "Human language is often ambiguous, underspecified, and grounded in the physical world and in social norms. As humans, we employ commonsense knowledge and reasoning abilities to fill in those gaps and understand others. Endowing NLP models with the same abilities is imperative for reaching human-level language understanding and generation skills. In this talk, I will present several lines of work in which we test NLP models on their commonsense reasoning abilities, develop commonsense reasoning models, and incorporate them into models to improve the performance on NLP tasks."

  title: "Generative Models for Stylized Geometry"
  abstract: "Recent advances in stylizing 2D digital content have sparked a plethora of image stylization and non-photorealistic rendering technologies. However, how to generate stylized 3D geometry remains a challenging problem. One major reason is the lack of suitable “languages” for computers to understand the style of 3D objects. In this talk, I will cover three increasingly popular perspectives for computers to capture geometric styles, including rendering, machine-learned geometric prior, and surface normals. I will demonstrate how these perspectives can enable computers to generate stylized 3D content. I argue that exploring fundamental style elements for geometry would unlock the door to learning-based and optimization-based techniques for geometric stylization."
