  title: Inference-Time Guided Generation Using Diffusion and Flow models
  html: true
  abstract: "Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed the creative process, making it easier than ever to generate realistic images and videos. While the quality of generated outputs has reached unprecedented levels of realism, the current challenge lies in improving controllability and alignment with user preferences. To address this, recent advancements in LLMs have shifted the focus beyond scaling training data and model size to scaling inference-time computation, as demonstrated by the AGI-level performance of models like GPT-4o and DeepSeek. In this talk, I will discuss inference-time generation techniques for guided image and video synthesis. Specifically, I will introduce particle sampling approaches that leverage the stochastic nature of the generative process, branching the generation trajectory to scale up and search for the desired output, albeit at the cost of increased inference-time computation. I will highlight their capabilities, limitations, and potential future directions."

  title: Attention Mechanism in Generative Models
  abstract: The rapid evolution of Large-scale Text-to-Image (T2I) models has revolutionized creative domains by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts. Attention layers play a critical role in these generative models. In my talk, I will show that these layers capture rich semantic information, and particularly semantic correspondences between elements within the image and across different images. Through several works, I will show that the rich representations learned by these layers can be leveraged for various image manipulations, and consistent image generation.

  title: 3D scene reconstruction, generation and understanding
  abstract: "In this talk, I will present datasets, methods, and code developed in our lab to support research in 3D computer vision. I will begin with a brief overview of our current research projects, and then focus on one project centered around 3D scene reconstruction, generation, and understanding. I will introduce our CUDA-based deep learning library designed for 3D surface parsing. This library features mesh-specific convolutional operations and a parallel algorithm for mesh decimation. Next, I will discuss our work on sketch-conditioned 3D object and indoor scene generation, where we leverage external knowledge to improve scene realism and coherence. While text and images are commonly used as inputs for 3D generation, we argue that hand-drawn sketches offer more intuitive alignment with user intent. I will also touch on the unique challenges of outdoor 3D scene generation, which suffers from greater complexity and data scarcity. To address this, our lab has released several large-scale city-level 3D LiDAR datasets, which support outdoor scene generation and understanding. Finally, I will present our approach for generating outdoor 3D point clouds from hand-drawn bird’s-eye-view sketches. To enable this, we align terrestrial LiDAR point clouds with satellite imagery and process the satellite views to produce sketch-like renderings suitable for training the generative model."

  title: "Exploring Trustworthy Foundation Models: Benchmarking, Finetuning and Reasoning"
  abstract: In the current landscape of machine learning, where foundation models must navigate imperfect real-world conditions such as noisy data and unexpected inputs, ensuring their trustworthiness through rigorous benchmarking, safety-focused finetuning, and robust reasoning is more critical than ever. In this talk, I will focus on three recent research advancements that collectively advance these dimensions, offering a comprehensive approach to building trustworthy foundation models. For benchmarking, I will introduce CounterAnimal, a dataset designed to systematically evaluate CLIP’s vulnerability to realistic spurious correlations, revealing that scaling models or data quality can mitigate these biases, yet scaling data alone does not effectively address them. Transitioning to finetuning, we delve deep into the process of unlearning undesirable model behaviors. We propose a general framework to examine and understand the limitations of current unlearning methods and suggest enhanced revisions for more effective unlearning. Furthermore, addressing reasoning, we investigate the reasoning robustness under noisy rationales by constructing the NoRa dataset and propose contrastive denoising with noisy chain-of-thought, a method that markedly improves denoising-reasoning capabilities by contrasting noisy inputs with minimal clean supervision. Furthermore, l will introduce the newly established Trustworthy Machine Learning and Reasoning (TMLR) Group at Hong Kong Baptist University.

  title: Test-Time Updates - Next Steps for Robust and Efficient Vision
  html: true
  abstract: "Learning from data is essential for state-of-the-art vision, but learning once is not be enough. When the data shifts between training and testing the accuracy of predictions can degrade. The problem is that the data changes, but our systems remain the same. Does it have to stay this way? In this talk we will examine how visual recognition can adapt and generalize to new and different data during testing. We will cover natural shifts, such as image corruptions, to highlight opportunities to update models (by entropy minimization and parameter mixing) and to update inputs (by diffusion) when the data differs. Then we will take a critical look at adversarial attacks through our case study of test-time adaptive defenses. As a last step, we will discuss test-time updates as a kind of multi-modeling—or how to apply multiple models at the same time—and summarize progress on efficiency, uncertainty, and adaptivity by multi-modeling."

  title: Machines Multimodal Learning from Generic Problem Descriptions to Design Better Software
  html: true
  abstract: Modern software development is increasingly data-rich but context-poor—particularly in its early stages, where the goal is to define problems rather than simply solve them. Although developers have access to vast repositories of community knowledge machine learning models still struggle to generalize across domains or respond to novel user needs without the crutch of large, labeled datasets. This challenge is especially pronounced in requirements engineering, where understanding user intent across diverse modalities—including text, visuals, and regulatory artifacts—is critical. <p> In this talk, I introduce Discovery-Driven Learning (DDL), a methodology aimed at improving machine comprehension of generic and often ambiguous problem descriptions, without relying on memorized or narrowly scoped training data. Grounded in the principles of READI (Reading-based Extraction and Analysis of Design Intent), our approach combines multimodal grounding, language-conditioned policy learning, and just-in-time reasoning to teach machines how to interpret requirements from textual, visual, and structural inputs. <p> This need for generalizability becomes even more pressing in the earlier phases of development, where traditional elicitation and inception techniques fall short of scaling across application domains. I will present how our research addresses this gap by enabling more adaptable, explainable, and human-in-the-loop-friendly AI systems. The talk will highlight real-world applications in digital health, aviation, emergency response, and software automation—demonstrating how DDL can power the next generation of intelligent co-pilots in software engineering and beyond.

In this talk, I introduce its usage in machine learning by exploring the use of tilting in risk minimization. The tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM) framework is a simple extension of ERM, which uses exponential tilting to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses. I motivate the tilted objective from real-world use-cases on addressing representation disparity in federated learning. I describe several useful theoretical properties of TERM including its connections with other non-ERM objectives, and a multitude of applications regarding fair and robust ML. I will conclude the talk by discussing ongoing work on leveraging this framework to improve sharpness-aware optimization, as well as generalization error analysis of TERM."

  title: "Integrating Machine Learning and Control for Safe and Efficient Robot Decision-Making"
  abstract: "Robots are envisioned to become reliable human companions in domains ranging from industrial applications to our daily lives. In the literature, well-established control techniques provide the foundation for designing high-performance autonomous robot systems with desired theoretical guarantees. However, these control techniques often rely on a dynamics model of the robot, and any inaccuracies of the model can result in suboptimal performance or even unsafe actions. This limitation motivates incorporating learning into the traditional robot decision-making software stack. In our work, departing from control theory, we develop neural control approaches that safely and efficiently exploit the expressiveness of neural networks to enhance the performance of robots in uncertain environments. This talk will encompass a set of our neural control work ranging from offline inverse dynamics learning for improving the performance of robots to online Lipschitz network adaptation for closing the model-reality gap in uncertain robot systems. We demonstrate our approach in real-time robot experiments, including quadrotor impromptu trajectory tracking and flying an inverted pendulum. In this talk, I will also introduce our review paper on safe learning in robotics and related benchmarking efforts that are targeted to provide an overarching view of the recent advances in learning-based control and reinforcement learning for robotic applications. I will conclude by sharing our latest work that closes the perception-action loop with a semantic understanding and thereby enables robots to safely operate in everyday scenarios."

In recent years, rapid deep learning-driven advances in research have translated directly into commercial products. Despite significant advancements in deep learning-based research leading to successful commercialization, major challenges remain for the data-hungry machine learning approaches. Arguably the most important problem is the lack of training data covering the whole variety of human motions; it is even questionable whether such data can ever be recorded. This talk will present several solutions for monocular human motion capture that side-step the problem of missing data using weakly- or unsupervised machine learning techniques in conjunction with geometric modeling. It will also give an outlook on future applications in motion analysis by capturing human dynamics involving forces and torques inside and on the human body."

  title: "Efficient and Adaptive Thompson Sampling Algorithms for Bandits"
  abstract: "A Multi-armed bandit problem is a classical sequential decision-making problem in which the goal is to accumulate as much reward as possible. In this learning model, only a limited amount of information is revealed in each round. The imperfect feedback model results in the learning algorithm being in a dilemma between exploration (gaining information) and exploitation (accumulating reward). Thompson Sampling, one of the oldest randomized learning algorithms, is able to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation and it always has a very competitive empirical performance. We study Thompson Sampling-based algorithms for stochastic bandits with bounded rewards. As the existing problem-dependent regret bound for Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors is vacuous when the learning horizon T ≤ 6235149080811616882909238708, we derive a more practical bound. Additionally, motivated by large-scale real-world applications that require scalability, adaptive computational resource allocation, and a balance in utility and computation, we propose a parameterized Thompson Sampling-based algorithm: Thompson Sampling with Timestamp Duelling (TS-TD-α), where we use α ∈ [0, 1] to control the trade-off between utility and computation."

  abstract: "Large-scale models trained with internet-scale data show great promise in transforming the way we work and solve complex problems. However, while LLMs and VLMs can interpret text or single image data, they face challenges in understanding spatial relationships under existing multi-modal training paradigms. Future intelligent AI systems must be able to perceive structured 3D environments before they can reliably interact with the physical world, which is essential for autonomous systems. Current 3D reconstruction pipelines still rely on modular, non-differentiable processing systems, preventing scalable training.  My research will first delve into the geometric principles necessary for high-quality multi-view geometry. Subsequently, we aim to push the boundaries of 3D learning by developing a unified representation, termed the Large Spatial Model, for real-time, end-to-end semantic 3D reconstruction. This model will support both feed-forward reconstruction and interaction through language with minimal annotated 3D data. By enabling the training of large-scale 3D models that effectively represent structured 3D worlds in low-dimensional latent embeddings, we can leverage the knowledge from LLMs, facilitating reliable spatial reasoning capacities. Applications such as multi-modal SLAM, human avatar creation, and controllable driving scene simulation will be empowered by 3D foundation models coupled with domain-specific designs."

  title: "Differentiable Constructive Solid Geometry and Fuzzy Logic"
  abstract: "Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) models complex 3D objects by combining simple primitive shapes with boolean operations. It plays a central role in 3D content creation, such as being a popular modeling paradigm for many industrial design and engineering applications. However, performing optimization on the CSG representation (e.g., training a neural network to output CSG trees) remains a challenging task. This is because the traditional formulation is not differentiable and often requires expensive combinatorial optimization. In this talk, we will show how we can draw inspiration from Fuzzy Logic and make CSG differentiable from the first principle. This enables us to optimize CSG shapes simply with e.g. gradient descent. We believe this could open up new ways to revisit CSG from a different lens."

  title: "Routing and Scheduling in Answer Set Programming applied to Multi-Agent Path Finding"
  abstract: "We present alternative approaches to routing and scheduling in Answer Set Programming (ASP), and explore them in the context of Multi-agent Path Finding. The idea is to capture the flow of time in terms of partial orders rather than time steps attached to actions and fluents. This also abolishes the need for fixed upper bounds on the length of plans. The trade-off for this avoidance is that (parts of) temporal trajectories must be acyclic, since multiple occurrences of the same action or fluent cannot be distinguished anymore. While this approach provides an interesting alternative for modeling routing, it is without alternative for scheduling since fine-grained timings cannot be represented in ASP in a feasible way. This is different for partial orders that can be efficiently handled by external means such as acyclicity and difference constraints. We formally elaborate upon this idea and present several resulting ASP encodings. Finally, we demonstrate their effectiveness via an empirical analysis."

  abstract: "With enough knowledge about the world we are looking at, a single image is enough to recover the 3D structure of the scene in front of our eye(s) - when we close one eye we still perceive the world in 3D. Computer vision started to explore monocular depth estimation (“monodepth”) much later than depth from stereo images (or, equivalently, camera motion). It is only recently that computational methods for monodepth have reached a comparable maturity. In the talk, I will briefly recap the development of monodepth algorithms over the past 20 years, and present our own contributions to the topic. I will argue that we may be reaching the point where monodepth modules become a commodity that we download and deploy off-the-shelf, just like stereo reconstruction."

  title: "Scaling Graph Transformers with Expander Graphs"
  abstract: "Following their runaway success in modelling natural language and other areas, there has been much recent attention to different variants of Transformers for graph data, which may be more able to handle long-range dependencies than previous variants of graph neural networks. These models generally allow all nodes to attend to all other nodes, however, leading to both computational and statistical challenges. This talk will present two models that help with this problem. Exphormer adds “virtual nodes” as well as augmenting the attention mechanism with an expander graph, whose mathematical characteristics help propagate long-range information at cost only linear in the size of the graph. Incorporating this into the GraphGPS framework realized state-of-the-art performance on several interesting datasets. For relatively-dense input graphs, however, even attention on the original graph structure may be too expensive to run for especially large graphs. We demonstrate that even low-width graph Transformers can provide useful signal as to which attention pathways are important in a large graph, and use this to propose Spexphormer, a model which scales Exphormers to very large graphs in transductive settings."

  abstract: "In many applications, machine learning models are deployed for human use (e.g., a diagnostic assistant for clinicians). Over the last 2 years, this setting has become even more widespread with the adoption of large language models (LLMs) as assistants in a wide variety of contexts spanning both professional and non-professional disciplines. In this talk, we explore through a set of case studies how we might incorporate humans in the ML training paradigm. These case studies include (1) applying classical computer vision models in a clinical trial study to assistant patients in taking higher quality medical images in telemedicine, (2) using an empirical model for human behavior to fine-tune a generic classifier to align with human utilization, and (3) analyzing human interaction patterns with image generation models. We also present some initial results that are inspired by the methods of (2) to the large language model setting. Across these studies, we take the position and discuss why it is imperative to treat humans as part of the model optimization process."

In Specformer, we improve traditional spectral GNNs by incorporating a set-to-set spectral filter with self-attention mechanisms, achieving expressiveness while maintaining permutation equivariance. Specformer significantly outperforms existing models in synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating a better ability to capture complex spectral patterns. Concurrently, we significantly tighten the PAC-Bayes in-distribution generalization bounds for GNNs and provide new out-of-distribution generalization bounds based on spectral graph theory. Our empirical validations confirm that GNNs achieve strong size generalization performance in cases guaranteed by our theory."

  abstract: "Today, thousands of robots are navigating autonomously in warehouses, transporting goods from one location to another. While numerous planning algorithms are developed to coordinate robots more efficiently and robustly, warehouse layouts remain largely unchanged – they still adhere to the traditional pattern designed for human workers rather than robots. In this talk, I will share our recent progress in exploring layout design and optimization to enhance large-scale multi-robot coordination. I will first introduce a direct layout design method, followed by a method to optimize layout generators instead of layouts. I will then extend these ideas to virtual layout design, which does not require changes to the physical world that robots navigate and thus has the potential for applications beyond automated warehouses."

  abstract: "The coordination of robots and other agents becomes more and more important for industry. For example, on the order of one thousand robots already navigate autonomously in Amazon fulfillment centers to move inventory pods all the way from their storage locations to the picking stations that need the products they store (and vice versa). Optimal and even some approximately optimal path planning for these robots is NP-hard, yet one must find high-quality collision-free paths for them in real-time. Algorithms for such multi-agent path-finding problems have been studied in robotics and theoretical computer science for a longer time but are insufficient since they are either fast but of insufficient solution quality or of good solution quality but too slow. In this talk, I will discuss different variants of multi-agent path-finding problems, cool ideas for both solving them and executing the resulting plans robustly, and several of their applications.

Computer graphics is extremely powerful in creating content for the virtual world. The connection is therefore a natural one as the digital fabrication hardware is starving for innovative content. In this talk, I will focus on inverse design, a powerful paradigm of content synthesis for digital fabrication, which creates fabricable designs given the desired performances.

  title: "Learning Options by Extracting Programs from Neural Networks"
  abstract: "In this talk, I argue for a programmatic mindset in reinforcement learning, proposing that agents should generate libraries of programs encoding reusable behaviors. When faced with a new task, the agent learns how to combine existing programs and generate new ones. This approach can be helpful even when policies are encoded in seemingly non-decomposable representations like neural networks. I will show that neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions can be mapped to a program with if-then-else structures. Such a program can then be easily decomposed into sub-programs with the same input type of the original network. In the case of networks encoding policies, each sub-program can be seen as an option---a temporally extended action. All these sub-programs form a library of agent behaviors that can be reused later, in downstream tasks. Considering that even small networks can encode a large number of sub-programs, we select sub-programs that are likely to generalize to unseen tasks. This is achieved through a subset selection procedure that minimizes the Levin loss. Empirical evidence from challenging exploration scenarios in two grid-world domains demonstrates that our methodology can extract helpful programs, thus speeding up the learning process in tasks that are similar and yet distinct from the one used to train the original model."
  bio: "Dr. Levi Lelis is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta, an Amii Fellow, and a CIFAR AI Chair. Levi’s research is dedicated to the development of principled algorithms to solve combinatorial search problems. These problems are integral to optimizing tasks in various sectors. Levi’s research group is focused on combinatorial search problems arising from the search for programmatic solutions---computer programs written in a domain-specific language encoding problem solutions. Levi believes that the most promising path to creating agents that learn continually, efficiently, and safely is to represent the agents’ knowledge programmatically. While programmatic representations offer many advantages, including modularity and reusability, they present a significant challenge: the need to search over large, non-differentiable spaces not suited for gradient descent methods. Addressing this challenge is the current focus of Levi’s work."

  title: "Quantum Computing for Robust Fitting"
  abstract: "Many computer vision applications need to recover structure from imperfect measurements of the real world. The task is often solved by robustly fitting a geometric model onto noisy and outlier-contaminated data. However, relatively recent theoretical analyses indicate that many commonly used formulations of robust fitting in computer vision are not amenable to tractable solution and approximation. In this paper, we explore the usage of quantum computers for robust fitting. To do so, we examine the feasibility of two types of quantum computer technologies---universal gate quantum computers and quantum annealers---to solve robust fitting. Novel algorithms that are amenable to the quantum machines have been developed, and experimental results on current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ) will be reported.

  title: "Efficient, Less-biased and Creative Visual Learning"
  abstract: "In this talk I will discuss recent methods from my group that focus on addressing some of the core challenges of current visual and multi-modal cognition, including efficient learning, bias and user-controlled generation. Centering on these larger themes I will talk about a number of strategies (and corresponding papers) that we developed to address these challenges. I will start by discussing transfer learning techniques in the context of a semi-supervised object detection and segmentation, highlighting a model that is applicable to a range of supervision: from zero to a few instance-level samples per novel class. I will then talk about our recent work on building a foundational image representation model by combining two successful strategies of masking and sequential token prediction. I will also discuss some of our work on scene graph generation which, in addition to improving overall performance, allows for scalable inference and ability to control data bias (by trade off major improvements on rare classes for minor declines on most common classes). The talk will end with some of our recent work on generative modeling which focuses on novel-view synthesis and language-conditioned diffusion-based story generation. The core of the latter approach is visual memory that implicitly captures the actor and background context across the generated frames. Sentence-conditioned soft attention over the memories enables effective reference resolution and learns to maintain scene and actor consistency when needed."

  title: "Building Practical Statistical Relational Learning Systems"
  abstract: "In our increasingly connected world, data comes from many different sources, in many different forms, and is noisy, complex, and structured. To confront modern data, we need to embrace the structure inherent in the data and in the predictions. An effective means of approaching this problem of structured prediction, is statistical relational learning (SRL). SRL frameworks use weighted logical and arithmetic expressions to easily create probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) to jointly reason over interdependent data. However, despite being well suited for modern, interconnected data, SRL has several challenges that keep it from becoming practical and widely used in the machine learning community. In this talk, I address four pillars of practicality for SRL systems: scalability, expressivity, model adaptability, and usability."
  bio: "Eriq Augustine (he/him) started his Computer Science career at California State Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, where he earned his BS and MS in Computer Science in 2013. Eriq's Master’s research was on micro-text classification and was done under Dr. Alexander Dekhtyar.

  title: "Towards Controllable 3D Content Creation by leveraging Geometric Priors"
  abstract: "The growing popularity for extended realities pushes the demand for the automatic creation and synthesis of new 3D content that would otherwise be a tedious and laborious process. A key property needed to make 3D content creation useful is user controllability as it allows one to realize specific ideas. User-control can be of various forms, e.g. target scans, input images or programmatic edits etc. In this talk, I will be touching works that enable user-control through i) object parts and ii) sparse scene images by leveraging geometric priors. The former utilizes object semantic priors by proposing a novel shape space factorization through an introduced cross diffusion network that enabled multiple applications in both shape generation and editing. The latter leverages pretrained models of large 2D datasets for sparse view 3D NeRF reconstruction of scenes by learning a distribution of geometry represented as ambiguity-aware depth estimates. As an add-on, we will also briefly revisit the volume rendering equation in NeRFs and reformulate it to piecewise linear density that alleviates underlying issues caused by quadrature instability."

  title: "Uncertain Surface Reconstruction"
  abstract: "We propose a method to introduce uncertainty to the surface reconstruction problem. Specifically, we introduce a statistical extension of the classic Poisson Surface Reconstruction algorithm for recovering shapes from 3D point clouds. Instead of outputting an implicit function, we represent the reconstructed shape as a modified Gaussian Process, which allows us to conduct statistical queries (e.g., the likelihood of a point in space being on the surface or inside a solid). We show that this perspective improves PSR's integration into the online scanning process, broadens its application realm, and opens the door to other lines of research such as applying task-specific priors."

  title: "Generative Models for Stylized Geometry"
  abstract: "Recent advances in stylizing 2D digital content have sparked a plethora of image stylization and non-photorealistic rendering technologies. However, how to generate stylized 3D geometry remains a challenging problem. One major reason is the lack of suitable “languages” for computers to understand the style of 3D objects. In this talk, I will cover three increasingly popular perspectives for computers to capture geometric styles, including rendering, machine-learned geometric prior, and surface normals. I will demonstrate how these perspectives can enable computers to generate stylized 3D content. I argue that exploring fundamental style elements for geometry would unlock the door to learning-based and optimization-based techniques for geometric stylization."
