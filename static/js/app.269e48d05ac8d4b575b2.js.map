Hence, a rigorous and accurate evaluation of the trustworthiness of DL systems is important and would be a prerequisite for improving DL trustworthiness. The first part of the talk will be an overview of certified methods for DL trustworthiness. These methods provide computable guarantees for DL systems in terms of worst-case trustworthiness under certain realistic conditions, such as the accuracy lower bound against arbitrary tiny perturbations. Based on our taxonomy and systematization, we reveal key methodologies and implications of certified DL trustworthiness. We will illustrate two concrete methods: semantic randomized smoothing and branch-and-bound with differentiable linear relaxations. As a representative of recent DL breakthroughs, large language models (LLMs) are transforming our lives, but on the other hand, posing more challenges to trustworthiness. For example, LLMs can be jailbroken with adversarial prompts to output harmful content with bias, harassment, misinformation, and more. The second part of the talk will be an overview of LLM trustworthiness. We will start with sharing my hands-on experience in developing state-of-the-art LLMs in the industry, then illustrate common LLM trustworthiness issues via examples, and conclude by envisioning certifiable trustworthiness for LLMs\"}},{\"time\":\"Mar 1st, 9:30-10:45am\",\"speaker\":\"Wuyang Chen\",\"event\":{\"title\":\"Automated, Interpretable, and Scalable Scientific Machine Learning\",\"description\":\"The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), propelled by data-centric scaling laws, have significantly transformed our understanding and generation of both vision and language. However, natural media, such as images, videos, and languages, represent only a fraction of the modalities we encounter, leaving much of the physical world underexplored. We propose that Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) offers a knowledge-driven framework that complements data-driven AI, enabling us to better understand, visualize, and interact with the diverse complexities of the physical world.  In this talk, we will delve into the cutting-edge intersection of AI and SciML. First, we will discuss the automation of scientific analysis through multi-step reasoning grounded with formal languages, paving the way for more advanced control and interactions in scientific models. Second, we will demonstrate how SciML can streamline the visualization of intricate geometries, while also showing how spatial intelligence can be adapted for more robust SciML modeling. Finally, we will explore how scaling scientific data can train foundation models that integrate multiphysics knowledge, thereby enhancing traditional simulations with a deeper understanding of physical principles.\"}}]},{\"date\":\"2024-12-10\",\"shortname\":\"neurips-2024\",\"title\":\"SFU at NeurIPS 2024\",\"venue\":\"neurips\",\"year\":2024,\"type\":\"conference\",\"location\":\"Vancouver Convention Center\",\"html\":\"We will be holding a series of morning talks in parallel with NeurIPS at the SFU downtown campus.

Given the complex models that we now deploy, how can we enforce such robustness properties while keeping model flexibility and utility?<br/>I will present recent work on Adaptive Randomized Smoothing (ARS), an approach we developed to certify the predictions of test-time adaptive models against adversarial examples.

In the first part of this talk, I’ll give a quick overview of my research on processing vector sketch data. In the second part, I’ll shift focus to artistic styles, and in particular to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method widely used to customize image diffusion models with individual styles. LoRA has become popular in online creative communities due to its low resource requirements, while also raising concerns around attribution and ownership. To better understand the relationship between LoRA weights and the adapted styles, we analyze the weights directly in the parameter space, avoiding the need for image generation and prompt engineering. We find that the LoRA weights themselves serve as effective style representations, capturing fine-grained stylistic differences and outperforming image-based features in clustering and retrieval. Beyond analysis, merging LoRA weights to synthesize new styles is a common practice. However, existing tools rely on manual sliders, which are often inefficient and unintuitive. In our ongoing project, we adapt a human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization framework to our setting for more effective interactions.\",\"bio\":\"Chenxi Liu is a postdoctoral researcher in the Dynamic Graphics Project at the University of Toronto, working with Alec Jacobson.

In the literature, well-established control techniques provide the foundation for designing high-performance autonomous robot systems with desired theoretical guarantees. However, these control techniques often rely on a dynamics model of the robot, and any inaccuracies of the model can result in suboptimal performance or even unsafe actions. This limitation motivates incorporating learning into the traditional robot decision-making software stack. In our work, departing from control theory, we develop neural control approaches that safely and efficiently exploit the expressiveness of neural networks to enhance the performance of robots in uncertain environments. This talk will encompass a set of our neural control work ranging from offline inverse dynamics learning for improving the performance of robots to online Lipschitz network adaptation for closing the model-reality gap in uncertain robot systems. We demonstrate our approach in real-time robot experiments, including quadrotor impromptu trajectory tracking and flying an inverted pendulum.

In this learning model, only a limited amount of information is revealed in each round. The imperfect feedback model results in the learning algorithm being in a dilemma between exploration (gaining information) and exploitation (accumulating reward). Thompson Sampling, one of the oldest randomized learning algorithms, is able to achieve a good balance between exploration and exploitation and it always has a very competitive empirical performance. We study Thompson Sampling-based algorithms for stochastic bandits with bounded rewards. As the existing problem-dependent regret bound for Thompson Sampling with Gaussian priors is vacuous when the learning horizon T ≤ 6235149080811616882909238708, we derive a more practical bound. Additionally, motivated by large-scale real-world applications that require scalability, adaptive computational resource allocation, and a balance in utility and computation, we propose a parameterized Thompson Sampling-based algorithm: Thompson Sampling with Timestamp Duelling (TS-TD-α), where we use α ∈ [0, 1] to control the trade-off between utility and computation.\",\"bio\":\"Bingshan Hu is a postdoctoral researcher co-hosted by Danica Sutherland and Mathias Lécuyer in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia.

Future intelligent AI systems must be able to perceive structured 3D environments before they can reliably interact with the physical world, which is essential for autonomous systems. Current 3D reconstruction pipelines still rely on modular, non-differentiable processing systems, preventing scalable training.  My research will first delve into the geometric principles necessary for high-quality multi-view geometry. Subsequently, we aim to push the boundaries of 3D learning by developing a unified representation, termed the Large Spatial Model, for real-time, end-to-end semantic 3D reconstruction. This model will support both feed-forward reconstruction and interaction through language with minimal annotated 3D data. By enabling the training of large-scale 3D models that effectively represent structured 3D worlds in low-dimensional latent embeddings, we can leverage the knowledge from LLMs, facilitating reliable spatial reasoning capacities.

The idea is to capture the flow of time in terms of partial orders rather than time steps attached to actions and fluents. This also abolishes the need for fixed upper bounds on the length of plans. The trade-off for this avoidance is that (parts of) temporal trajectories must be acyclic, since multiple occurrences of the same action or fluent cannot be distinguished anymore. While this approach provides an interesting alternative for modeling routing, it is without alternative for scheduling since fine-grained timings cannot be represented in ASP in a feasible way. This is different for partial orders that can be efficiently handled by external means such as acyclicity and difference constraints. We formally elaborate upon this idea and present several resulting ASP encodings.

As traditional tools, such as computer aided design, manufacturing, and engineering (CAD/CAM/CAE) lag behind this new paradigm, the field of computational fabrication has recently emerged from computer graphics to address this knowledge gap with a computer-science mindset. Computer graphics is extremely powerful in creating content for the virtual world. The connection is therefore a natural one as the digital fabrication hardware is starving for innovative content. In this talk, I will focus on inverse design, a powerful paradigm of content synthesis for digital fabrication, which creates fabricable designs given the desired performances.

When faced with a new task, the agent learns how to combine existing programs and generate new ones. This approach can be helpful even when policies are encoded in seemingly non-decomposable representations like neural networks. I will show that neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions can be mapped to a program with if-then-else structures. Such a program can then be easily decomposed into sub-programs with the same input type of the original network. In the case of networks encoding policies, each sub-program can be seen as an option---a temporally extended action. All these sub-programs form a library of agent behaviors that can be reused later, in downstream tasks. Considering that even small networks can encode a large number of sub-programs, we select sub-programs that are likely to generalize to unseen tasks. This is achieved through a subset selection procedure that minimizes the Levin loss. Empirical evidence from challenging exploration scenarios in two grid-world domains demonstrates that our methodology can extract helpful programs, thus speeding up the learning process in tasks that are similar and yet distinct from the one used to train the original model.\",\"bio\":\"Dr. Levi Lelis is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta, an Amii Fellow, and a CIFAR AI Chair.

The task is often solved by robustly fitting a geometric model onto noisy and outlier-contaminated data. However, relatively recent theoretical analyses indicate that many commonly used formulations of robust fitting in computer vision are not amenable to tractable solution and approximation. In this paper, we explore the usage of quantum computers for robust fitting. To do so, we examine the feasibility of two types of quantum computer technologies---universal gate quantum computers and quantum annealers---to solve robust fitting. Novel algorithms that are amenable to the quantum machines have been developed, and experimental results on current noisy intermediate scale quantum computers (NISQ) will be reported.
