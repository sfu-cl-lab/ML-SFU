The idea is to capture the flow of time in terms of partial orders rather than time steps attached to actions and fluents. This also abolishes the need for fixed upper bounds on the length of plans. The trade-off for this avoidance is that (parts of) temporal trajectories must be acyclic, since multiple occurrences of the same action or fluent cannot be distinguished anymore. While this approach provides an interesting alternative for modeling routing, it is without alternative for scheduling since fine-grained timings cannot be represented in ASP in a feasible way. This is different for partial orders that can be efficiently handled by external means such as acyclicity and difference constraints. We formally elaborate upon this idea and present several resulting ASP encodings.

These models generally allow all nodes to attend to all other nodes, however, leading to both computational and statistical challenges. This talk will present two models that help with this problem. Exphormer adds “virtual nodes” as well as augmenting the attention mechanism with an expander graph, whose mathematical characteristics help propagate long-range information at cost only linear in the size of the graph. Incorporating this into the GraphGPS framework realized state-of-the-art performance on several interesting datasets. For relatively-dense input graphs, however, even attention on the original graph structure may be too expensive to run for especially large graphs. We demonstrate that even low-width graph Transformers can provide useful signal as to which attention pathways are important in a large graph, and use this to propose Spexphormer, a model which scales Exphormers to very large graphs in transductive settings.",bio:"Danica Sutherland is an Assistant Professor at UBC Computer Science, and a Canada CIFAR AI Chair at Amii.

When faced with a new task, the agent learns how to combine existing programs and generate new ones. This approach can be helpful even when policies are encoded in seemingly non-decomposable representations like neural networks. I will show that neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions can be mapped to a program with if-then-else structures. Such a program can then be easily decomposed into sub-programs with the same input type of the original network. In the case of networks encoding policies, each sub-program can be seen as an option---a temporally extended action. All these sub-programs form a library of agent behaviors that can be reused later, in downstream tasks. Considering that even small networks can encode a large number of sub-programs, we select sub-programs that are likely to generalize to unseen tasks. This is achieved through a subset selection procedure that minimizes the Levin loss. Empirical evidence from challenging exploration scenarios in two grid-world domains demonstrates that our methodology can extract helpful programs, thus speeding up the learning process in tasks that are similar and yet distinct from the one used to train the original model.",bio:"Dr. Levi Lelis is an Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta, an Amii Fellow, and a CIFAR AI Chair.
